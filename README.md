BabelFrog
==========

A Google Chrome extension to help you learn a language as you browse the web. 
Uses Google Translate to translate the selected text.

Usage
-----

Activate the extension on the current page (like a bookmarklet) by pressing `Alt-F` or clicking on the frog icon.
Then any text you will select will be automatically translated via Google Translate.

By default the extension translates from French into English (because that's why I wrote it!) but you can easily
change this by clicking on the BabelFrog icon twice, to get this popup:

Installation
------------

Install from the chrome store. Or if you'd like to hack at the code yourself:

```
cd ~/code  #  or wherever you put your cloned github repos
git clone https://github.com/dergachev/babelfrog.git
```

Now open Chrome's extension management:
